## Development 

First, clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IdentityofSine/radioactive-forms
```

Then, install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

The examples (being the development environment) are in the `examples/` folder. We leverage these examples to develop with hot-reloading, so you can run the examples and see your changes live.
To run the (only) example:

```bash

npm run example:install
npm run example:dev
```

This should then run `vite` in the `examples/basic-react-forms` folder, which has a `path` set to the `~/src/index.ts` file, so you can develop the library while seeing your changes live in the example.
